# Quiver Theme â€” Atom One Dark

A Dark theme for [Quiver](https://itunes.apple.com/app/quiver-programmers-notebook/id866773894?ls=1&mt=12&at=11l5Lz) based on Atom's [One Dark UI](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui).

## Instalation

1. Either clone this repository or simply download the theme's [json file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pslobo/Quiver-Theme-Atom-One-Dark/master/Atom%20One%20Dark.json);
2. Then open settings, choose **Load Theme** and select the json file.


If you'd like to help, read the [documentation](https://github.com/HappenApps/Quiver/wiki/How-to-Design-a-Custom-Theme) on how to create a custom theme and then start hacking. I'm sure it'll be glaringly obvious, but CSS isn't my strong suite so there is much room for improvement.

## TODO

1. Improve syntax highligting for LaTEX and diagram cell. Colors still seem a little off;
2. Work on Preview, Presentation and Export themes;
3. !!Create syntax highligting for Ace Editor so that we have code cell to match the theme.
